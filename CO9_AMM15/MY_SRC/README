This directory contains a merging of AMM15 and MOMTRD code. The steps taken
were as follows:

1) List AMM15 files stored in CO_AMM15_main
2) Identify differences MOMTRD and standard nemo_4.0.4 for these scripts
          - scripts with no changes are copied here from CO_AMM15_main
          - scripts with changes are copied from nemo_4.0.4_trd/src
            and placed here
          - differences between nemo4.0.4 and AMM files are then identified
            and the respective MOM files (now here) are updated accordingly
            with AMM differences
3) All atmospheric diagnostics written by A Wise are added to this directory
